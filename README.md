# Predicting Churn Risk via Latent Customer Segmentation for Optimized Retention Strategies

## Overview

This project analyzes customer data from a retail business to identify and prioritize high-risk customer segments for targeted retention campaigns.  The analysis employs unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their behavioral patterns and demographic information.  By identifying latent customer segments exhibiting high churn propensity, the project aims to inform the development of effective retention strategies, ultimately minimizing churn and maximizing customer lifetime value.  The analysis includes exploratory data analysis, model training, and result visualization.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results and insights to the console, including details about the identified customer segments and their respective churn probabilities.  Additionally, the analysis generates several visualization files (e.g., `customer_segment_distribution.png`, `churn_probability_by_segment.png`) which provide a visual representation of the customer segmentation and churn risk.  These files will be saved in the project's directory.  The exact output will depend on the input data used.
